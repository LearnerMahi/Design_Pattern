LAZY WAY->
1.private constructor.
2.class type er variable private static declare kora lagbe(jeita by default null thakbe)
3.only akbar ontoto object create kora lagbe j methode(ei method(public) return type abar class type hobe) seita 
static hoite hobe keno?abong akbar instance create korar por jeno new classname(); abar call na hoi seitao ensure
kora lagbe.akbar create hok ba na hok oi object return kore dite hobe
4.create field to store object s private.
5.hashcode diye check korte hobe j object same kina.
6.main function e oi method diyei object call(1st bar er jonno create abong call onno sobbar er jonno only call)
kora lagbe.emne Class_name variable=Class_name.method();emne

in english.
1.You need a private constructor.
2.Declare a private static variable of the class type (which will be null by default).
3.Only once, an instance object needs to be created via a method (this method should be public and return type should
be of the class type). This method needs to be static because it ensures that the object creation occurs only once,
and subsequent calls to create the object are ignored.
4.Create a field to store the object privately.
5.Use the hashCode method to check if two objects are the same.
6.In the main function, call the method to create the object (create and call for the first time, and only call for
subsequent times).

EAGER WAY->
1.1st e class type er private static variable assign kore nite hobe(new class_name();)mane object create kore.
2.public static class_name method(){ return variable;} korte hobe

In ENGLISH->
1.Initially, you need to assign a private static variable of the class type by creating an object (new class_name();)
2.You need to create a public static method that returns the class_name variable.
In summary, in the eager way, the class creates the object as soon as it is loaded, and a static method returns that pre-created object.
